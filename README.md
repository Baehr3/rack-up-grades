# Rack-Up-Grades!!

This is a single-player game with a time limit and a leaderboard. We took inspiration from the classic carnival game Whack-A-Mole and digitalized it. 
The goal of the game remains the same. The player's main goal is to hit the mole however the specific rules change between the three levels provided: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

  The Easy level is meant to be almost a tutorial for how the game works at the basic level. The player needs to click the moles as they appear and they just accumulate points as time goes by.
  The Medium Level takes it a bit further by adding the rule that missing a mole means a certain amount of points is deducted from your overall score. 
  The Hard Level is the master level where not only do the 2 rules above apply but we have an additional bomb where clicking that will also result in deduction of points. 

  As the user finishes playing the game, the game prompts them with a message if they would like to add their score to the leaderboard. If they choose yes then they can enter their name and depending on whether or not they place within the top 10, their scores will be displayed on the leaderboard. This leaderboard can also be accessed in the main menu

## Special design structures

There are many interesting design decisions we had to make during this project and few of them have led to interesting and special design structures. 
The file directory is compatible with any operating system that works with Java. 


## Design Patterns

We decided to use 2 design patterns in our work: Adapter and Facade

- Adapter:

- Facade:


## Unit Testing

The tests we have made cover: test what happens if there are 10 ppl on the leaderboard but you want to add your score which is lower than all of theirs. 



## Scenario Walk-Throughs
